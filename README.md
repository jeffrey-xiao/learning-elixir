Various guides that I have been going through to learn Elixir, Phoenix, Mix, and OTP.

- `kv_umbrella_ex`: A distributed key-value store described in the [Mix and OTP
  guide](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html).
- `discuss_ex`: A forum built with Phoenix described in Stephen Grider's [The Complete Elixir and
  Pheonix Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-elixir-and-phoenix-bootcamp-and-tutorial)
  course.
