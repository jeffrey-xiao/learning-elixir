“I don’t know who you are. I don’t know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you
 I don’t have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired
 over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my
 daughter go now, that’ll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if

When I was very young, most of my childhood heroes wore capes, flew through the air, or picked up
 buildings with one arm. They were spectacular and got a lot of attention. But as I grew, my heroes
 changed, so that now I can honestly say that anyone who does anything to help a child is a hero to me.

We live in a world in which we need to share responsibility. It's easy to say, 'It's not my child,
 not my community, not my world, not my problem.' Then there are those who see the need and respond.
 I consider those people my heroes.

If you grew up with our Neighborhood, you may remember how we sometimes talked about difficult
 things. There were days ... even beautiful days ... that weren't happy. In fact, there were some
 that were really sad.  Well, we've had a lot of days like that in our whole world. We've seen what
 some people do when they don't know anything else to do with their anger.  I'm convinced that when
 we help our children find healthy ways of dealing with their feelings--ways that don't hurt them or
 anyone else--we're helping to make our world a safer, better place.  I would like to tell you what
 I often told you when you were much younger: I like you just the way you are.  and what's more,
 I'm so grateful to you for helping the children in your life to know that you'll do everything you
 can to keep them safe and to help them express their feelings in ways that will bring healing in
 many different neighborhoods.

What matters isn't how a person's inner life finally puts together the alphabet and numbers of his
 outer life. What really matters is whether he uses the alphabet for the declaration of a war or the
 description of a sunrise--his numbers for the final count at Buchenwald or the specifics of a
 brand-new bridge.

When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me,
 'Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.' To this day, especially in
 times of 'disaster,' I remember my mother's words, and I am always comforted by realizing that
 there are still so many helpers--so many caring people in this world.

There's no 'should' or 'should not' when it comes to having feelings.  They're part of who we are
 and their origins are beyond our control.  When we can believe that, we may find it easier to make
 constructive choices about what to do with those feelings.

Part of the problem with the word disabilities is that it immediately suggests an inability to
 see or hear or walk or do other things that many of us take for granted. But what of people who
 can't feel? Or talk about their feelings? Or manage their feelings in constructive ways? What of
 people who aren't able to form close and strong relationships? and people who cannot find
 fulfilment in their lives, or those who have lost hope, who live in disappointment and bitterness
 and find in life no joy, no love? These, it seems to me, are the real disabilities.

Confronting our feelings and giving them appropriate expression always takes strength, not
 weakness. It takes strength to acknowledge our anger, and sometimes more strength yet to curb the
 aggressive urges anger may bring and to channel them into non-violent outlets. It takes strength to
 face our sadness and to grieve and to let our grief and our anger flow in tears when they need to.
 It takes strength to talk about our feelings and to reach out for help and comfort when we need it.

Love isn’t a state of perfect caring. It is an active noun like /struggle/. To love someone is to

As human beings, our job in life is to help people realize how rare and valuable each one of us
 really is, that each of us has something that no one else has--or ever will have--something inside
 that is unique to all time. It's our job to encourage each other to discover that uniqueness and to
 provide ways of developing its expression.

A high school student wrote to ask, 'What was the greatest event in American history?' I can't say.
 However, I suspect that like so many 'great' events, it was something very simple and very quiet
 with little or no fanfare (such as someone forgiving someone else for a deep hurt that eventually
 changed the course of history). The /really/ important 'great' things are never center stage of
 life's dramas; they're always 'in the wings.' That's why it's so essential for us to be mindful of
 the humble and the deep rather than the flashy and the superficial.

    Fame is a four-letter word; and like tape or zoom or face or pain or life or love,
 what ultimately matters is what we do with it.  I feel that those of us in television are chosen to
 be servants. It doesn't matter what our particular job, we are chosen to help meet the deeper needs
 of those who watch and listen--day and night!  The conductor of the orchestra at the Hollywood Bowl
 grew up in a family that had little interest in music, but he often tells people he found his early
 inspiration from the fine musicians on television.  Last month a thirteen-year-old boy abducted an
 eight-year-old girl; and when people asked him why, he said he learned about it on TV. 'Something
 different to try,' he said. 'Life's cheap; what does it matter?' Well, life /isn't/ cheap. It's the
 greatest mystery of any millennium, and television needs to do all it can to broadcast that ... to
 show and tell what the good in life is all about.  But how do we make goodness attractive? By doing
 whatever we can do to bring courage to those whose lives move near our own--by treating our
 'neighbor' at least as well as we treat ourselves and allowing /that/ to inform everything that we
 produce.  Who in your life has been such a servant to you ... who has helped you love the good that
 grows within you? Let's just take ten seconds to think of some of those people who have loved us
 and wanted what was best for us in life--those who have encouraged us to become who we are tonight
 --just ten seconds of silence.*

 [Ten seconds elapse.]

 No matter where they are--either here or in heaven--imagine how pleased those people must be to
 know that you thought of them right now.  We all have only one life to live on earth. and through
 television, we have the choice of encouraging others to demean this life or to cherish it in
 creative, imaginative ways.

Most of us, I believe, admire strength. It's something we tend to respect in others, desire for
 ourselves, and wish for our children.  Sometimes, though, I wonder if we confuse strength and other
 words--like /aggression/ and even /violence/. Real strength is neither male nor female; but is,
 quite simply, one of the finest characteristics that any human being can possess.

Forgiveness is a strange thing. It can sometimes be easier to forgive our enemies than our friends.
 It can be hardest of all to forgive people we love. Like all of life's important coping skills, the
 ability to forgive and the capacity to let go of resentments most likely take root very early in
 our lives.

Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that

that I exist,' says God, `for proof denies faith, and 
without faith I am nothing.'

exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don't.

It is a relief and a joy when I see a regiment of hackers digging in to hold the line, and I realize, this city may survive--for now.

- Richard Stallman (Open Sources, 1999 O'Reilly and Associates)
%
If a machine couldn't run a free operating system, we got rid of it.

- Richard Stallman (Open Sources, 1999 O'Reilly and Associates)
%
The straightforward and easy path was to join the proprietary software world, signing nondisclosure agreements and promising not to help my fellow hacker....I could have made money this way, and perhaps had fun programming (if I closed my eyes to how I was treating other people).  But I knew that when my career was over, I would look back on years of building walls to divide people, and feel I had made the world ugly.
 
- Richard Stallman (Open Sources, 1999 O'Reilly and Associates)
%
But the most reliable indication of the future of Open Source is its past: in just a few years, we have gone from nothing to a robust body of software that solves many different problems and is reaching the million-user count. There's no reason for us to slow down now.

- Bruce Perens, on the future of Open Source software. (Open Sources, 1999 O'Reilly and Associates)
%
The reason for the success of this somewhat communist-sounding strategy, while the failure of communism itself is visible around the world, is that the economics of information are fundamentally different from those of other products.

- Bruce Perens, on Open Source software. (Open Sources, 1999 O'Reilly and Associates)
%
It is easy to sympathize with the MIS staffs around the world, I mean who hasn't lost work due to Windows or a Microsoft application crashing?

- Chris DiBona, happy he's been using Linux and can avoid such things, from the introduction. (Open Sources, 1999 O'Reilly and Associates) 
%
So I decided that if the architecture is fundamentally sane enough, say it follows some basic rules like it supported paging , then I would be able to say, yes, Linux fundamentally supports that model.

- Linus Torvalds on Portability (Open Sources, 1999 O'Reilly and Associates)
%
I'm not saying that they were knowingly dishonest, perhaps they were simply stupid. 

- Linus Torvalds, commenting on those who really thought microkernels were wise. (Open Sources, 1999 O'Reilly and Associates)
%
The idea of abstracting away the one thing that must be blindingly fast, the kernel, is inherently counter productive. 

- Linus Torvalds on Microkernels (Open Sources, 1999 O'Reilly & Associates)
%
So right now the only vendor that does such a stupid thing is Microsoft.

%
The world is beating a path to our door

- Bruce Perens, (Open Sources, 1999 O'Reilly and Associates)
%
If you want an application to be portable, you don't necessarily create an abstraction layer like a microkernel so much as you program intelligently.

- Linus Torvalds on Microkernels (Open Sources, 1999 O'Reilly and Associates)
%
Calling EMACS an editor is like calling the Earth a hunk of dirt.

- Chris DiBona on Dirt (Open Sources, 1999 O'Reilly and Associates)
%
I am not convinced that they can write solid stable software. Proprietary software is already hobbled by it's secretive cathedral nature, but Microsoft seems to have a corner on incompetent programming as well.

- Chris DiBona from the introduction. (Open Sources, 1999 O'Reilly and Associates)
%
The funny thing is if you actually read those papers, you find that, while the researchers were applying their optimizational tricks on a microkernel, in fact those same tricks could be applied to traditional kernels to accelerate their execution.

- Linus Torvalds on Microkernels (Open Sources, 1999 O'Reilly and Associates)
%
Computers and automation have become so ingrained and essential to day-to-day business that a sensible business should not rely on a single vendor to provide essential services...Thus it is always in customers' interests to demand that the software they deploy be based on non-proprietary platforms.

Nature abhors a vacuum

While not obviously a business-friendly license, there are certain aspects of the GNU license which are attractive, believe it or not, for commercial purposes.

The basic publication series for the IETF is the RFC series. RFC once stood for 'Request for Comments,' but since documents published as RFCs have generally gone through an extensive review process before publication, RFC is now best known understood to mean 'RFC'

So here's a picture of reality: (picture of circle with lots of squiggles in it) As we all know, reality is a mess.

However, complexity is not always the enemy.

You know, how is The Force like duct tape? Answer: it has a light side, a dark side, and it holds the universe together.

Of course, in Perl culture, almost nothing is prohibited. My feeling is that the rest of the world already has plenty of perfectly good prohibitions, so why invent more?

- Larry Wall (Open Sources, 1999 O'Reilly and Associates)

There are a billion people in China. and I want them to be able to pass notes to each other written in Perl. I want them to be able to write poetry in Perl. 

That is my vision of the Future. My chosen perspective.

- Larry Wall (Open Sources, 1999 O'Reilly and Associates)

In a way they were right - the basics of operating systems, and by extension the Linux kernel, were well understood by the early 70s; anything after that has been to some degree an exercise in self-gratification.

Bubbles: I think it.it was a zombie!
Buttercup: Cut it out, Bubbles. There.s no such thing as zombies.

...

Woman: A zombie!
%
Narrator: Oh, no! It's Al Lusion! He's returned from beyond the grave as 
      Abracadaver, the magical zombie!
%
Abracadaver: You laughed at me ... but now, revenge!
%
Mayor: Hmm. That's peculiar. Uh, Ms. Bellum, do you see this saw I see?
Ms. Bellum: Yes, but can't you see that all of Townsville is under attack?
Mayor: I think my hat's under attack! Call the haberdasher!
Ms. Bellum: Ahem!
Mayor: Oh, and the Powerpuff Girls.
%
Blossom: H-H-Hello?
%
Mayor: Blossom! You girls have to help at once!
Blossom: W-W-W-Why? What is it, Mayor?
Mayor: My favorite hat's been ruined, and, uh ... oh, yeah, Townsville's 
   under attack by an evil demented zombie magician.
Blossom: WHAT?! An evil demented zombie? 
Buttercup: No way! I'm not going!
Bubbles: Me neither. 
Blossom: I know it's scary, but.we have to.
%
Blossom: Oh ... um ... excuse me, Mr. Zombie, sir.
Abracadaver: Wha.?
Blossom: Could you stop destroying Townsville with your evil zombie magic?
Bubbles, Buttercup: Please?
%
Abracadaver: You! You're that girl! Girl with bear!
%
Blossom: Huh?
%
Buttercup: You put her down!
%
Buttercup: Uh-oh!
Abracadaver: You hit me!
%
Abracadaver: and now, my assistant ... time for grand finale!
%
Abracadaver: Now you meet your doom!
%
Narrator: Oh, no! Right before our very eyes ... the magic of the Powerpuff 
      Girls vanished forever! Now Townsville is at the mercy of that evil 
    magician Abraca-huh!
%
Blossom: Ta-da!
Narrator: Blossom?!
Crowd: Yaaay!
%
Girls: Ta-da!
Crowd: Yaaay!
Mayor: But, girls! How did you do it?
Girls: It's magic, silly!
%
Narrator: How? ... Who? ... When? ... But? ... Who's in the? ...
%
Narrator: Oh, girls! I love that voodoo that you do!
%
Narrator: So once again the day is saved ... thanks to the Powerpuff Girls!
%
Narrator: The city of Townsville ... and like most cities, Townsville prepares 
      its young for bed as evening approaches.
%
Buttercup: Man, I'm not ready for bed yet!
Blossom: Now, girls, you know we need to get plenty of sleep. It's our 
     responsibility as superheroines to be well-rested, so that we'll be 
   at peak crime-fighting performance whenever evil rears its ugly head.
%
Blossom: and, like Ben Franklin always said ... Early to bed, early to wake, 
     makes a lady smart, pretty, and great.
%
Buttercup: Yeah, yeah ... but all the fun stuff happens at night. Parties, 
       dancing, nightclubs and stuff. Girl, it'll be awesome once we're 
     old enough to go out after dark. Right, Bubbles?
Bubbles: Uh ... no.
Buttercup: What do you mean, no?
Bubbles: I don't know.
Buttercup: You're not afraid of the dark, are you?
Bubbles: No.
Buttercup: You ain't scared of monsters under the bed, are you?
Bubbles: No.
Buttercup: Well, then. I guess you wouldn't be afraid of the Boogie Man, 
       either.
Blossom, Bubbles: Who?
%
Buttercup: Boogie Man! The creepiest, scariest, nastiest, 
       long-finger-and-pointy-teeth-havingest, little-kid-gettingest 
     monster in the WORLD! But don't worry. He only comes out ...
     after dark!
%
Professor: Wha?
%
Blossom, Bubbles: IT'S THE BOOGIE MAN!
Professor: What? Boogie Man? What's going on in here?
%
Professor: Buttercup ... are you teasing your sisters again?
%
Professor: Okay, Bubbles, calm down. Everything's all right now.
%
Professor: Yes, Blossom, I know. Buttercup likes to be an instigator.
%
Buttercup: Well, it's not my fault she's a baby scared of the dark.
%
Professor: Now, girls, being scared doesn't make you a baby. I was scared 
       when I heard my girls screaming. But did I hide under the covers?
%
Professor: Thank you, Blossom. You see, bravery doesn't mean you're not 
       scared. Bravery is doing what you're afraid to do. If you can 
     just face your fears, then I know you can find the courage to 
     beat 'em.
%
Professor: Now, then, everyone, into bed. It's time for sleeping.
%
Professor: and no more monkey business!
%
Narrator: Some kind of crazy beat?
%
Jerome: Listen up, all you freaks and disasters, and chill the frag out! 
    'Cause here comes the master! So give it up for the beast with the 
  plan! The one, the only, B-B-B-Boogie Man!
%
Boogie Man: Creatures of darkness ... DIG IT! Too long have we been at the 
    mercy of light. Nightlights, streetlights, hall lights with the 
  door cracked. and deeper still ... the sun. I know, I know. But I, 
  your Boogie Man, have just completed Step One of my grand master 
  plan that will ensure an end to this problem once and for all. 
  So prepare to hit the streets ... cause we are gonna party ALL
  NIGHT LONG!
%
Boogie Man: So tell me. When things get creepy.
Crowd: Blame it on the boogie!
Boogie Man: When things get spooky.
Crowd: Blame it on the boogie!
Boogie Man: and when things get freaky, funky, and nasty.
Crowd: BLAME IT ON THE BOOGIE!!
%
Narrator: Uh-oh! What's he got cooking at the Townsville Power Plant?
%
Narrator: Oh, my gosh. They've cut off all power to Townsville! That means ...
      no more streetlights ... no more hall lights with the door 
    cracked ... and definitely no more nightlights!
%
Monster under bed: Hehehe The coast is clear! Come on!
%
Slug: Fashionably late again, I see. So fashionable you missed the party.
%
Slug: Peep it! The sun's already risin'. We're gonna have to blow this joint.
%
Bartender: LAST CALL!! 
Jerome: Let's wrap it up, people! The sun's comin' up!
Boogie Man: Hold up, hold up! Did you all forget about my grand master plan? 
    The sun will no longer be an issue once I initiate the third and 
  final step.
Slug: Is Step Three really all that?
Boogie Man: Shoot. It ain't no step for a stepper.
%
Narrator: It's a giant disco ball!
Narrator: and it's eclipsing the sun! Oh, no! Now morning will never come to 
      Townsville!
%
Narrator: and these nocturnal nightmares will be free to haunt the darkness 
      forever!
Crowd: BLAME IT ON THE BOOGIE!!
%
Blossom: I CAN'T GET ANY SLEEP!! With all that racket out there! Something 
     funky.s going on downtown.
Buttercup: I'll say! We better check it out!
Blossom: Yeah. It might be trouble!
%
Blossom: Oh, my gosh! Townsville's been turned into a nightmare nightclub!
Buttercup: Right on! Right, Bubbles?
Bubbles: Well, it's got a good beat, and I can dance to it. 
%
Cat: Yeah, little girl, I thought you liked to party.
%
Buttercup: Let's get down!
%
Narrator: Oh, no! The girls are getting swamped!
%
Blossom: I can see a small exhaust port at the end of the chasm. If we could 
     just hit it with our laser vision, it should destroy the ball!
%
Narrator: Oh, yes! The sun is free to shine on Townsville again! Sorry, 
      nightmares. Party's over. and don't let the doorknob hit ya where 
    the dog shoulda bit ya.
%
Bubbles: Okay! I'm ready!
Professor: Awww, ain't she cute?
%
Professor: You see, Bubbles, you're not ready for the higher levels yet. 
       Oh, don't worry, cheer up. Someday you will be.
Bubbles: It's not fair.
Professor: She's so cute when she's all pouty like that.
%
Bubbles: It's not fair! I'm just as tough and strong and mean as Buttercup 
     and Blossom, but they just don't believe me. They all treat me like 
   a baby. I'll show them. I'll prove that I can be ... hard-core!
%
Bubbles: Mission begin!
%
Bubbles: WHO ELSE WANTS SOME?!?
%
Blossom: What's the matter? Am I too fast for cute little Bubbles?
%
Bubbles: Ha! I got you! You're out! Gone! Finished! You were beaten down, 
     sister, by CUTE! LITTLE! BUBBLES!!
%
Talking Dog: Oh, hi, Bubbles. How are youuuuu.
Bubbles: Bad dog! Bad dog! BAD DOG!
%
Talking Dog: No, Bubbles! Have mercy!
Bubbles: Mercy is for the weak!
%
Blossom: Bubbles!
Buttercup: Have you lost your mind?
Blossom: This isn't the Bubbles we know!
Bubbles: The Bubbles you know is gone! I'm hard-core now!
%
Bubbles: I don't mean to burst your bubble, girls, but from now on ... I 
     fly solo!
%
Narrator: Whoa! Sister's doin' it for herself! Let's hope she knows what 
      she's doing.
%
Mojo: Now that I have you, my sweet little Bubbles ... nothing can stop my 
  plan to take over the world!
Bubbles: What plan?!
Mojo: I'll tell you! I plan to zap you with my laser, causing you to cry 
  out ... just wike a wittle baby ... which in turn will cause your 
  sisters to come flying to your rescue, for which I am well prepared, 
  as you can see.
%
Bubbles: That's the dumbest plan I've ever heard! AND I'M NOT A BABY!
%
Mojo: Well, we'll see about that!
%
Bubbles: I'm not.gonna..cry ... you.. dumb.. doo-doo-brain!
Mojo: Doo-doo-brain? That's it! I've had it with your sassy mouth! I didn't 
  want to do this!
%
Mojo: Yes! Yes! That's it!
%
Blossom: Wow, Bubbles! I can't believe you defeated Mojo all by yourself! 
     You really whooped him!
%
Blossom, Buttercup: You're hard-core!
%
Bubbles: Why, you! How dare you zap me and my sisters? Take this! and that! 
     and this! and this! and that!
%
Narrator: Oh, Bubbles, you're so cute when you're all tough like that! So 
      once again the day is saved ... thanks to the Powerpuff Girls!
%
Narrator: The city of Townsville. A pleasant place to live. Unless you run 
      into ... the Gangrene Gang! The biggest bunch of belligerent bullies 
    this town's ever seen!
%
Ace: Mister? You're talkin' to Ace, kid. There are no Misters here ... at 
     least, I don't think so. Um, Little Arturo, is your name Mister?
%
Grubber: Pbbbbpppppbbbbbt!
%
Ace: Yeah, I thought so. Hey, is your name Mister, Snake?
%
Blossom: Let the underwear go!
%
Arturo: The Powerpuff Girls?
Billy: The Powerpuff Girls?
Snake: The P-P-Powerpuff Girls-s-s?
Grubber: Pbbbbpppbbbt?
Ace: The Powerpuff Girls?
%
Ace: Oh, Powerpuff Girls ... please forgive my foolish friend for his foolish 
     act. For he did not know what he was doin'.  and I know deep inside my 
     heart that he would never do anything like that ever again. What do you 
     say, girls? Will you forgive him? Will you? Please?
%
Narrator: Oh, no! Looks like Buttercup is looking for love in all the wrong 
      places.
%
Narrator: Next day. Townsville Museum of Natural History.
%
Narrator: Oh, look! The Pokey Oak Kindergarten class is on a field trip. 
      and so is ... the Gangrene Gang?! This can't be good.
%
Billy: Big Billy no get soda.
Snake: I think she needs moneys-s-s.
Arturo: This Mesopotamian vase is probably worth a couple of bucks.
%
Ace: Slip it in right here, Arturo.
%
Ace: Now this has gotta be worth at least one soda.
Blossom: Drop that mummy!
Ace, Snake, Arturo, Billy: The Powerpuff Girls!
%
Blossom: All right, girls. Let's show these creeps how to respect other 
     people's property!
%
Ace: Hey. Buttercup, how come you guys always pick on us, huh?
%
Ace: W-We was only tryin' to get a soda.
%
Ace: You know, kid? You're not so bad. You can hang out with us anytime.
%
Narrator: That evening ... Oh, no! ... She isn't! ... She is.
%
Narrator: I hope she knows what she's doing.
%
Snake: W-W-W-What-What she's doing here-s-s, Boss-s-s?
Ace: Back up! Relax!
%
Ace: Buttercup. Please, come in.
%
Ace: Oh, Buttercup! Last night was a hoot! So will you please be my guest 
     again tonight?
%
Ace: Don't you realize that with Buttercup on our side ... 
     WE COULD CONTROL TOWNSVILLE?!
%
Ace: Sit for a spell, fellas, 'cause I've got a plan.
%
Narrator: Well, that sounds awful! Evil people with evil plans? I hope the 
      Powerpuff Girls can get out of this one ... especially Buttercup!
%
Ace: Showtime!
%
Snake: Huh? Oh, right. See you two a little bit laters-s-s.
Ace: They'll be back. With pizza!
%
Snake: Come on, s-s-stop laughing! Do it rights-s-s!
%
Grubber: Oh, hello. I'm Buttercup, and my foot got caught in a conveyor belt 
     at the city dump. I'm afraid I'm stuck. Help me!
Bubbles: Okay. Bye-bye. BUTTERCUP'S IN TROUBLE!!
%
Snake: S-S-Say goodbye, Powerpuffs-s-s!
%
Narrator: This is unbelievable! Is this the end of our beloved girls?
%
Narrator: Can no one save our heroes from this impending doom? Can Buttercup 
      not hear her sisters' cries for help?
%
Narrator: Oh, no! Blossom and Bubbles' screams are being drowned out by this 
      rogue Romeo's rambunctious rock!
%
Snake: Adios-s-s, dos amigos-s-s!
%
Ace: Buttercup, I'm innocent! The boys, they put me up to it! Honest!
%
Narrator: Aww, we forgive you, Buttercup.
%
Narrator: and so once again the day is saved ... thanks to the Powerpuff Girls!
%
Narrator: The city of Townsville. A place where catastrophe can strike at 
      any minute.
%
Bubbles: You're the most cutest kitty in the whole world. Yes, you are. and 
     to think that mean old man had you all to himself. Do you think 
   we'll be able to keep him?
%
Buttercup: We're not keeping that stinky fleabag. Because I'm gonna end up 
       feeding it, and cleaning it, and loving it.
%
Girls: Awwww
%
Bubbles: No, you didn't. We're just getting ready for bed. and everything is 
     as normal as normal could beEEEEE!
%
Blossom: Well, there was this bad man, and he had this raygun.
Buttercup: and then we were punching and kicking, and then the cops came.
Bubbles: and then the place started to fall apart!
%
Professor: But Kitty can stay tonight. I have a lot of work to do in the lab, 
       so I'll decide tomorrow. Now get those sleepy heads into bed.
%
Professor: Good night, little angels.
%
Blossom: The cat's in the bag once the Professor sees his breakfast!
%
Professor: No! None of you can ever hold Kitty!
%
Professor: Girls! I know I haven't told you, but the laboratory is now off 
       limits. Bye.
%
Professor: Yes, Master.
%
Kitty: Purrrrrrfect.
%
Blossom: Bubbles, you get it. I'm too tired.
Bubbles: Powerpuff hotline.
Bubbles: We're on our way, Mayor! WAKE UP!!
%
Bubbles: Wait! What if the cat is really the bad guy, and he put the Professor 
     under a hypnotic trance and made the Professor build this evil 
   machine, and then they stole the jewel to power the machine, and then 
   they're gonna use it to hypnotize all the people so that the cats can 
   rise up and take over Townsville?!
Buttercup: Bubbles, if we didn't have to sit through your ridiculous 
       ramblings, we.d be halfway to solving this crime!
%
Narrator: Oh, Bubbles ... you don't know how right you are! For at this very 
      moment, a catastrophe is about to befall ... the city of Townsville!
%
Kitty: and now for the final step. Professor?
%
Kitty: Activate the beam!
Professor: Yes, Master.
%
Professor: Girls! Oh'oh, I just had the craziest dream! I dreamt I was 
       hypnotized by a cat, we stole a jewel, and I jumped off a building!
     Pretty crazy, huh?
%
Narrator: Oh, be quiet! Bad kitty! If you think the girls are gonna help you, 
      you're barking up the wrong .. I mean, you're meowing up the .. 
    the .. oh, well.
%
Narrator: The city of Townsville! ... A community where random acts of kindness
      are an everyday occurrence.
%
Fuzzy: Hey, you! Get offa my property! Now!
%
Narrator: Some people like ... Fuzzy Lumkins!
%
Fuzzy: Get offa my property!
%
Fuzzy: Hey! Get off my property right now!
%
Fuzzy: Consarn it! Anyone else wanna try and get on my property?!
%
Fuzzy: Jo? Jo? Where you at, Jo? Where is you? Jo! Joey! J-oh.
%
Fuzzy: Now you stay right 'cheer, Jo .. where you gonna be safe .. from all 
   y'all who wants to get your mitts on my property!
%
Narrator: Oh, no! He's heading towards Townsville!
%
Fuzzy: Where you at, you crazy critter?
%
Old woman: Excuse me, sonny, but I believe you dropped your hat.
%
Fuzzy: GET YOUR WRINKLES OFFA MY PROPERTY!!
%
Fuzzy: Stop it, stop it, STOP IT! Stop touchin' my property!
%
Policeman: So, you like punchin' out old ladies, huh? Well .. I have one 
       question for you... Is this your hat?
%
Fuzzy: Y'ALL GET YOUR MITTS OFFA MY PROPERTY!!
%
Blossom: Who are you to come mess up our town?
%
Fuzzy: GET .. OFFA .. MY .. PROPERTY!!
%
Fuzzy: OH, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!
%
Fuzzy: Huh?
%
Narrator: Townsville Prison!
%
Narrator: How do you like that, Mr. No-Share?
%
Narrator: So once again the day is saved .. thanks to the Powerpuff Girls! I 
      get a warm, fuzzy feeling just saying that.
%
Narrator: The city of Townsville .. A place filled with some of the most 
      brilliant, clever, and ingenious criminal masterminds ever to hatch 
    an evil scheme.
%
Narrator: Then there's the Amoeba Boys.
%
Bossman: We did it! We're official criminals!
Tiny: Yeah, criminals!
Skinny: Yeah!
%
Bossman: You didn't take it, did you?
Tiny: He didn't take it, Boss!
Skinny: I was going to, but .. that would be stealing.
%
Bossman: That's it! I spend months planning that orange heist, and you go 
     and choke at the last minute. Don't you have any backbone, you.
%
Blossom: Sorry, guys. You're gonna have to do better than that. Come on, 
     girls. Let's go.
%
Bossman: No! Wait! So you wanna see a crime, huh?
%
Narrator: Townsville Park .. A clean place for clean folks to have good clean 
      fun.
%
Mayor: Hello? He .. What? .. You can't come in? .. You're sick? What? Hello? 
   You're sick too, you can't come in. Hello? Hello .. You're sick? Sick! 
   Sick! Everyone's sick! Oh! Ms. Bellum. Thank goodness you're here.
%
Blossom: I'll get it! Yes, Mayor? What's the trouble? Huh? You're sick? .. 
     Well, that's too bad, Mr. Mayor, but it doesn't sound like an 
   emergency. Now, tell everyone to get lots of rest and drink plenty of 
   liquids. and only call when there's a real emergency. Remember .. 
   the hotline is not a toy.
%
Kids: ICE CREAM!!
%
Girls: Ewwwwww!
%
Buttercup: Uh-oh. Look!
%
Bubbles: Sorry, guys. I gotta go save people and stuff.
%
Bossman: Hey, Buttercup.
Buttercup: Buzz off, guys!
%
Bossman: Okay, we got a crime. Watch!
Blossom: Cut it out, guys! Not now!
%
Buttercup: You three are the lousiest, most pathetic criminals ever to walk 
       the street! You stink! We don't ever want to see you again! Get 
     out of town! Don't ever come back! Get out! Get out! GET OUT!!
%
Professor: Sick. I know. I'm already working on it. I've managed to isolate 
       the virus, but it doesn't conform to any virus ever documented. I 
     believe it's a new strain. Have a look.
%
Blossom: Professor .. those look just like the Amoeba Boys.
%
Professor: The Amoeba Boys? Hmm. I wonder if .. now this is only a hunch, but 
       suppose the Amoeba Boys were standing in the park next to a Keep 
     Off the Grass *cough* sign, in an attempt to break the law .. when 
     a storm rolled in. Now suppose they stood in the rain all night and 
     caught a *cough* cold. That cold could mix with their single-cell 
     anatomy to create a devastating new virus .. that could then infect 
     all of Townsville.
%
Professor: Of course, that's only a hunch. Girls! You must find the Amoeba 
       Boys. The antidote is within them! Do you know where they are?
%
Narrator: and so the Powerpuff Girls began to search for the hosts *cough* of 
      one of the most deadly viruses ever to befall mankind.
%
Blossom: Uh..? The Amoeba Boys?  Oh .. you gotta come back with us right away.
Bossman: But I thought we were lousy criminals and you never wanted to see 
     us again.
Blossom: No! That's not true! You three could be the worst criminals in the 
     history of Townsville.
%
Bossman: Wait a minute! Why should I, copper? You're not taking us without a 
     fight!
Tiny: Yeah! Without a fight!
%
Professor: Okay, Amoeba Boys. Thank you for your cooperation. You're free to go.
Bossman: Go?! I thought we were criminals! You locked us up and everything!
Professor: Well, everything's all right now. Out you go.
%
Professor: Bye now.
Bossman: I told you, you shoulda taken the orange!
%
Professor: Force equals the cosine of the direct.no, that's not it! .. Darn it!
%
Blossom: This oatmeal's too hot!
Bubbles: Too hot!
Buttercup: So blow on it!
%
Narrator: and wouldn't you know, of all days, today would be the day Blossom 
      discovers she has a new power.
%
Narrator: Ice breath!
%
Blossom: Hey guys, look what I just did!
Buttercup: Hmmm .. do it again.
%
Bubbles: I know, I know! Make the floor all ice, like in Tom and Jerry. 
     That's my favorite.
%
Buttercup: Yeah! Make the floor all ice, Blossom!
Blossom: Well, I'll try.
%
Professor: ButterCUUUUUP!
%
Professor: How on earth did you do it?
Bubbles: She blowed, and ice came out!
Buttercup: She's got ice breath, Professor!
Professor: You're kidding! Show me, Blossom.
%
Professor: Incredible!
%
Professor: Well, Buttercup .. you know, even though you all have super 
       abilities like super strength and being able to fly and laser eye 
     beams, you also each have your own special unique abilities, like 
     Bubbles being able to speak Spanish.
Bubbles: Sí!
%
Ms. Keane: Of all the days for the air conditioner to break!
%
Ms. Keane: Teddy, I don't care. Now go play!
%
Narrator: Outside? In this heat wave? Oh, the poor little things.
%
Repairman: Sorry, Ms. Keane. I'll have to come back tomorrow.
Ms. Keane: Great. Just great! Stupid heat! It's like walking into an oven!
%
Bubbles: Ms. Keane! Ms. Keane! Blossom's doing something bad.
Ms. Keane: What are you talking about? Blossom never does anything bad.
%
Ms. Keane: It's wonderful!
Blossom: Thanks.
Ms. Keane: Blossom, what a nice thing you're doing.
%
Buttercup: That stupid goody-goody Blossom never gets in trouble!
%
Buttercup: Hello? .. A robbery? .. We'll be right there!
%
Buttercup: Hey, ice princess! We got work!
Blossom: Oh, okay. I just gotta finish making snow cones for everybody.
Buttercup: Forget it. Come on, Bubbles!
%
Driver: Did you get the ice?
%
Bubbles, Buttercup: Not so fast, bad guys!
Crook: The Powerpuffs! Step on it!
%
Blossom: Here I am. Did I miss anything? Oh, look! Bad guys! Stand back, girls!
%
Blossom: Whoops!
Crooks: Thanks, Blossom!
%
Buttercup: Way to go, ice princess!
Bubbles: You did a bad thing, Blossom.
Blossom: I know. Sorry, Mr. Policeman. Sorry, people of Townsville. Sorry, 
     tree. I promise I will never use my ice powers again!
%
Ms. Bellum: Staring at the sun again, Mayor?
Mayor: Yes! I'm trying to find the source of this hea..ooh!
%
Mayor: Goodness gracious, great ball of fire!
Ms. Bellum: Yes, it's called the sun.
Mayor: No! There's another giant ball of fire, and it's heading straight for 
   Townsville!
%
Buttercup: Come on, Bubbles!
%
Buttercup: Blossom, forget your promise and DO SOMETHING!
%
Mayor: Oh, good! Blossom has stopped the giant fireball.
Ms. Bellum: Yes, but now there's a giant ice ball hurtling towards us.
Mayor: Yes, but it's not a giant fireball!
%
Mayor: It's so cold! We could really use a giant fireball about now.
%
Governor Tarkin:
  The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any
  concern to us. I have just received word
  that the Emperor has dissolved the council
  permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic
  have been swept away.
Commander:
  But that's impossible. How will the emperor
  maintain control without the bureaucracy?
Governor Tarkin:
  The regional governors now have direct
  control over their territories. Fear will keep the
  local systems in line. Fear of this battle station.

Luke Skywalker:
  I'm Luke Skywalker, I'm here to rescue you.

C-3PO:

Princess Leia Organa: 
  Help me, Obi-wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.

Ben (Obi-Wan) Kenobi: 
  For more than a thousand generations
  the Jedi were the guardians of peace and
  justice in the galaxy. Before the dark times.
  Before the Empire.

Luke Skywalker:

Chewbacca:

  But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.
Han Solo:
  That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out
  of their sockets when they lose. Wookiees are known

IN the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.  and the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep.  and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.  and God said, Let there be light: and there was light.  and God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.  and God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.  and the evening and the morning were the first day.  and God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.  and God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.  and God called the firmament Heaven.  and the evening and the morning were the second day.  and God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.  and God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.  and God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.  and the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.  and the evening and the morning were the third day.  and God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:  and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.  and God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.  and God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,  and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.  and the evening and the morning were the fourth day.  and God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.  and God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.  and God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.  and the evening and the morning were the fifth day.  and God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.  and God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.  God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.  So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.  and God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.  and God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.  and to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.  and God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. and the evening and the morning were the sixth day.  THUS the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.  and on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.  and God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.

NOW the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made.  and he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?  and the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.  and the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.  and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.  and the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.  and they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.  and the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?  and he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.  and he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked?  Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?  and the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.  and the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done?  and the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.  and the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: and I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.  Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.  and unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. and Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.  Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.  and the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.

Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.  and the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.  and the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.  and Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.

The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.  and God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.  and God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.  Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.  and this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.  A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.

and, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.  But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.  and of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.  Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.  and take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.  Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.

AND the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.  Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female.  Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.  For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.  and Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.

and Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.  and Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.  Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth, There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah.  and it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.  In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.  and the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.

In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark; They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort.  and they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life.  and they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.  and the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth. and the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.  and the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.  Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.  and all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man: All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.  and every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.  and the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.

AND God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged; The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained; and the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated. and the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.  and the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.

and it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made: and he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.  Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground; But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.  and he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark; and the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.  and he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.  and it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.  and in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.

and God spake unto Noah, saying,
Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.  Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.  and Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him: Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.  and Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.  and the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.  While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.
